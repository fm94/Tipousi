# Tipousi - a tiny and fast deep learning framework from scratch in C++

This is a WIP project that implements an entire deep learning framework from scratch in C++.</br>
The goal is to implement as many layers and modules as possible and have a python interface at the end.</br>
This will probably take some time but it would help me understand the tiny details behind many concepts. 


## Include externals (submodules)
git submodule init
git submodule update
