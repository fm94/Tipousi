# Tipousi - a tiny and fast deep learning framework from scratch in C++

[![Tipousi Build Status](https://github.com/fm94/Tipousi/actions/workflows/cmake-multi-platform.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/fm94/Tipousi/actions/workflows/cmake-multi-platform.yml)

This is a WIP project that implements an entire deep learning framework from scratch in C++.</br>
The goal is to implement as many layers and modules as possible and have a python interface at the end.</br>
This will probably take some time but it would help me understand the tiny details behind many concepts. 


## Include externals (submodules)
```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## TODOs
- implement more stuff...
- focus of backward pass implementation

- add enum for initial weights distribution
- allow for multiple inputs/outputs to sequential
